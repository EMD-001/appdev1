For this assignment, you will research at least five emerging technologies that are impacting both the education sector and the IT industry. For each technology, provide the following:
Purpose: Explain the primary goal or benefit of the technology.
Usage: Describe how the technology is utilized in both education and IT.
Examples: Provide specific examples of how this technology is applied in real-world scenarios.



1. Virtual Reality

- Virtual reality is created by the latest technology, wherein users interact with a computer-generated environment.
It produces digital experience to the user by offering a replica or different from our real world. It has a computer-generated 3D environment. 

- The main purpose of virtual reality is to enhance user-experience. The technology today is advancing creating and meeting the needs of the people. 
Virtual reality immerses the user to a world where they can experience that they are part of it.

- Virtual reality is being used in education for example in science by building an immersive   environment that creates interactive simulations, and hands-on instruction. 
It will create a profound effect in how we retain information. 
In Information Technology it will improve how the IT develop software, design and also how they can collaborate through virtual spaces for example in training they can practice in VR environment. 


2. Internet of Things(IoT)


- The IoT enhances productivity, connectivity, and data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing various sectors. IoT automates tasks in intelligent homes and industrial environments, leading to reduced energy usage and less downtime through proactive maintenance. IoT improves safety and resource management by using advanced security measures and monitoring environmental conditions in real-time, leading to cost savings and greater efficiency in resource utilization.


- The Internet of Things transforming the education and IT sectors by enhancing  productivity and connectivity. 

     * In education sectors for example smart classrooms where students use interactive whiteboards that enhance collaboration and learnings. 
       Also RFID badges of the students that school can monitor the attendance in real-time. 

     * In IT sectors Iot applied through solutions for example smart technology that can monitor and manage the company systems. These applications of IoT enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness


3. Cloud computing
 
The primary goal of cloud computing is to provide easy access to any computing resources and IT applications all over the internet. Users can obtain different IT services and reduce the complications in maintaining or operating the system because the vendor is in-charge with that. 

Cloud computing has transformed the way resources are obtained and controlled, enhancing technology's flexibility and availability in different industries.

* In education sectors  

Cloud computing is used as an online learning platform that can reach across the world. For example LMS the school uses this tool for the students to still manage to do their activities and quizzes even though they are at home or whenever they are in the world. 

* In IT sectors 

IT companies use cloud computing as a backup solution for possible data loss or system failures. For example google cloud backup, companies use this as an automatic backup for their systems most especially if this is critical applications for ensuring that they have a backup and it is easy to recover when there are sudden problems. 


4. Blockchain technology

The main purpose of blockchain technology is to provide a decentralized database where it is secured and transparent. Unlike centralized databases where there is a single authority that controls all the data, blockchain contributes all the ledger to the users to ensure the integrity and also to show transparency. 


* For education sectors 

Blockchain can be utilized as a verification tool to ensure the authenticity. All over the world fake certificates and school related stuff is alarming by using this kind of technology schools and companies can verify if their certificate is real and not altered. For example, certificate management Universities can store their certificates as unchangeable entries on the blocks. 
By including precise URLs in their social media profiles, email signatures, and resumes, students can easily share these credentials because blockchain is decentralized, all documents stored there are transparent and verifiable. 


* For IT sectors 

Blockchain technology is used in IT firms for example in cybersecurity they use this kind of technology. The first cybersecurity platform for IoT businesses enabled by blockchain technology is called Xage. With multi-factor authentication and self-healing capabilities in the event of a breach, the technology allows for the simultaneous management of multiple devices.


5. Artificial intelligence

The main purpose of Artificial Intelligence is to create a machine that is capable of doing various tasks that align with human intelligence. Examples of this are problem-solving and decision-making processes that enhance the accuracy, scalability and efficiency. 


* For education sector

AI is used in the education sector to perform tasks more efficiently and to make school loads bearable both to teachers and students. For example, the application Cram101 turns the textbook into a guide complete with summaries, quizzes and such for students to retain and learn more about the subjects and to test also what they learn in the lesson. 


* For IT sectors 

In the IT sectors artificial intelligence is used for enhancing cybersecurity by detecting threats and making solutions in real time. For example, Darktrace AI tools for cybersecurity is a program to identify ongoing threats inside the system because it detects anomalies and abnormalities, even the unknown threats. 
These AI tools also adapt to any type of threat make this as one of the best AI tools for cybersecurity.
